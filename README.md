# toy-chess

Chess programming hobby project, taken on as I had an urge to re-learn C, and I thought I should learn how to play chess.

Progress ground to a halt several months back, due to a complete lack of spare time. 

## TODO

Nearly everything!

* Chess algebra interpretetr
* Move generation for opening pawns, en-passant, and castling
* Move validator
* 2 player mode
* 1 player mode with some kind of AI

## Build and run the test suite

```bash
make
./testchess
```

That's about it! There is also a board drawing function which can be used to visualize move generation, but there isn't yet a main game play program

## Useful resources

* [Chess programming wiki](https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/) - this is a fantastic site, but I've generally tried my own approaches before consulting it
* [Bit twiddling hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)
